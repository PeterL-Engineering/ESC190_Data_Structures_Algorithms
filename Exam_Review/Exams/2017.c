Q. 1

a)
    - Header files help you separate declaration and implementation of function/DSA
    - Helps make code more resuable by allowing you to import into other files

    - Easier deubgging and code organization
    - Optimized code compilation (only the modified source files need to be recompiled)

    - Significantly reduce development time by providing read-made functions
    - Portable across different compilers and platforms

b) return value = 0.75

c) 
    - Saves memory and can be used when you know the value will not be negative
    - In a signed bit, the most significant bit (MSB) is reserved for the sign

d) 
    - Incorrect assignment for b
    - Function returns local pointer
